# Dimensionality Reduction

![Dimensionality Reduction](dimensionality_reduction.png)

  This repository's main goal is to describe and document dimensionality reduction techniques. "What is dimensionality reduction? Why should I know about it?", one might ask. Well, when working with highly dimensional, complex datasets, dimensionality reduction helps the user discover actionable information faster, without, say, "handpicking which data to look".
  
  Moreover, many machine learning models don't deal well at all with highly dimensional data, so dimensionality reduction help remove a lot of the "noisy", undesired data.
